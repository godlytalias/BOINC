BOINC
=====

BOINC (Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Networked Computing) is a software system that makes it easy for researchers to create diverse applications, including those with large storage or communication resources and operate computationally intensive projects. BOINC projects are generally community built, and topics vary through all branches of science. Anybody can contribute to these projects by donating their computing power, when idle.
